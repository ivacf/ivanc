# ivanc-An amazing website

This repository contains two applications: 

1. A [React app](/web-client) that displays information about the author and his/her work as a software developer.
See deployed at http://ivanc.uk
2. A [Django server app](/server) that assists the React app by providing data via a REST API.
See deployed at https://api.ivanc.uk

## React app

Source code located under `/web-client`. This React app is set up with [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) and
[Express](http://expressjs.com/) so that the React components are rendered in the server side. 

#### Getting started
1. `npm install`: install app dependencies.
3. Make sure the companion API app is running at`http://localhost:8000/`  
4. `npm start`: start the dev server at `http://localhost:3000/`
5. Modify any of the components under [`/src`](web-client/src) and see the changes in real time thanks to
[React Hot loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)

#### Deployment
This app can be deployed as a Node application on Heroku or Dokku.
There is a `heroku-postbuild` script in [`package.json`](web-client/package.json) so every time the app is pushed to Heroku,
Webpack compiles the JavaScript code in production mode. Webpack outputs the result into `public/bundle.js` that is loaded
from [`index.html`](web-client/index.html). This `index.html` file is then served with Express when the root endpoint is
requested. See [`server.js`](web-client/server.js) for more details. 

There are a couple of **environment variables** that need setting up before deploying:
* `API_BASE_URL`: The URL where the Django server app is deployed. e.g. https://api.ivanc.uk/
* `GA_TRACKING_CODE`: Your Google Analytics tracking code.


## Django server app

Source code located under `/server`. This Django API provides data such as a list of apps, articles and open source repositories through a REST API. It also provides an admin panel that allows adding, deleting and amending data with ease. It's implemented using [Django REST Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/). 

#### Getting started
* Create a Python virtual environment under `/server`. You can follow [this guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/).
* Set up the Django settings environment variable: `export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=ivanc.dev_settings`. To avoid having to do this every time you can add this line to the `activate` script file located in your virtual environment `env/bin/activate`
* Activate the environment: `source env/bin/activate`
* Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
* Now you're ready to run the dev server: `python manage.py runserver`

#### Testing
This Django project contains test for all endpoints. You can run them with `python manage.py test`. Some endpoints call external APIs. In order to avoid flaky tests, these external interactions are mocked using [VCR.py](https://github.com/kevin1024/vcrpy). Note the first time you run them they will perform real HTTP interactions. Consecutive executions will reuse the first response and the tests will no longer call the external API. 

#### Deployment
This app can be deployed as a Django application on Heroku or Dokku. The following **environment variables** are expected:

* `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`: This must point to the prod settings file `ivanc.prod_settings`
* `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`: A random key used by Django. More info [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/settings/#std:setting-SECRET_KEY). 
* `DATABASE_URL`: Pointing to a PostgreSQL database. This variable is usually set up automatically by Heroku or Dokku after linking your app to a database.

An AWS bucket is required to store media files. You can follow [this tutorial](https://www.caktusgroup.com/blog/2014/11/10/Using-Amazon-S3-to-store-your-Django-sites-static-and-media-files/) to create an AWS bucket with the right permissions. Once that is done, you must point Django to your AWS bucket by adding these three env variables: 

* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
* `AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME`

The `/repos` endpoint uses the GitHub API to pull data about repositories. The call doesn't require any authentication, however the GitHub API has very low [rate limits](https://developer.github.com/v3/rate_limit/) when performing non-authenticated calls. If you want to increase this limit to avoid problem you can [create a GitHub OAuth application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) and use the generated values to set up two more variables:

* `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`
* `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`
